# XGBoost


#### Before we go into XGBoost, what is supervised learning?
Supervised learning has ___labeled data___, for example checking if there is an apple in a picture or not. The model must know what an apple looks like in its own knowledge base(eg. pixels which makes up an apple from training data), with this, it has the knowledge the label 1 for yes there is an apple, or 0 for no there isn't an apple.

Supervised learning can take in numeric or categorical features, numerical features are scaled, categorical features are encoded

#### Supervised Learning: Classification
1. Binary Classification: Whether a customer will click on an ad given the ad content and historical data of the user 

*Metrics of binary classification:* AOC curve

2. Multiclass Classification: Classifying species of a given bird

*Metrics of Multiclass classification:* Accuracy score and confusion matrix

##### Supervised Learning: Regression:



#### What is XGBoost?
XGBoost is an optimized gradient boosting machine library, which stands for extreme gradient boosting. The algorithm has these following features:

1. Sparse Aware implementation with automatic handling of missing data values.
2. Block Structure to support the parallelization of tree construction.
3. Continued Training so that you can further boost an already fitted model on new data.
