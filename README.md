# XGBoost


#### Before we go into XGBoost, what is supervised learning?
Supervised learning has labeled data, for example checking if there is an apple in a picture or not. The model must know what an apple looks like in its own knowledge base(eg. pixels which makes up an apple from training data), with this, it has the knowledge the label 1 for yes there is an apple, or 0 for no there isn't an apple.
